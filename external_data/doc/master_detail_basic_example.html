    This is a basic master/detail view. Click a <span> <i class="icon-detail-plus"></i></span> button to preview detail
    records. Use the "Full view" link or drop-down menu of a <span> <i class="icon-detail-additional"></i></span> button
    to display details on a separate page.

    Starting from the version 16.9 it is possible to add, edit, and delete detail records without opening a separate page.
