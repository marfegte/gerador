    You can compare multiple records and find the differences between their values with a few mouse clicks. Just select
    two or more records (the selection management button will appear), then choose &quot;Compare&quot; from the
    button's drop down menu. Lazy users can simply click one of ready-to-use links below:

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="?operation=compare&keys[0][0]=8&keys[1][0]=6&keys[2][0]=3&keys[3][0]=1">Compare all iPhones with display size 4.7 inches</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="?operation=compare&keys[0][0]=9&keys[1][0]=7&keys[2][0]=4&keys[3][0]=2">Compare all iPhones with display size 5.5 inches</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="?operation=compare&keys[0][0]=10&keys[1][0]=9&keys[2][0]=7&keys[3][0]=4">Compare iPhone X with the latest iPhone 'Plus' versions</a>
    </li>
</ul>

    By default, values are compared with the == operator. You can also
    <a href="http://www.sqlmaestro.com/products/mysql/phpgenerator/help/01_03_04_33_on_get_custom_compare_values/" target="_blank">define your own function</a>
    that compares the values with the algorithm you provided. For example, you can implement a case-insensitive comparison or consider
    two values equal if their difference is less than a predefined value. Click the <span><i class="icon-question"></i></span>
    button to see how such a function has been implemented for the page below.
